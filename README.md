# Ardrone 2.0 Control

With this code you can control the *AR Drone 2.0* with your computer or phone using [PyDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid) (recommended).  

This was made in the intention of replacing the app from the Play Store that was removed (still available on App Store) and for control of the drone on Mac and Linux.
